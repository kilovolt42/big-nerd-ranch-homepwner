# Homepwner

This is my work on the Homepwner exercise from Big Nerd Ranch's [iOS Programming](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/ios-programming.html) (4th Edition), Chapter 19 Bronze Challenge.

The Homepwner app is a home inventory manager. Use it to record items you own and it will keep track of each item's name, serial number, value, and photograph. This app stores your data using Core Data. It runs on both iPhone and iPad as a Universal application.
